# Pipeline: entity-scaffold

> Adds one already-approved backend entity through the repository's complete data path:
> Zod contract → Drizzle schema → generated migration → org-scoped service → validated
> Server Actions → meaningful demo fixture → integration tests. It does not decide which
> entities the product needs.

## Goal

Turn one approved, ordinary property-child entity contract into a complete, tenant-safe
backend scaffold without inventing fields or widening product scope.

## Scope gate

The ticket must explicitly mark the entity contract approved and provide:

- singular and plural names, table name, human-readable ID prefix, and cache tag;
- every field's domain name, Zod type, database column/type, optionality, and default;
- the `propertyId` relationship and delete behavior;
- one meaningful demo fixture;
- the product capability that will consume the entity.

Use this ticket shape so every run receives the same explicit contract:

```markdown
---
category: building
type: entity
priority: normal
created: YYYY-MM-DD
approved: true
---

## Product capability
<the approved user capability that needs this entity>

## Entity contract
- Singular name:
- Plural name:
- Table name:
- ID prefix:
- Cache tag:

| Domain field | Zod type | DB column | DB type | Required | Default |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

Relationship: `propertyId → properties.id`, delete cascade.

## Demo fixture
<one complete, meaningful record>
```

This pipeline accepts exactly one new entity with the standard shape:

- non-null `orgId`, `userId`, and `propertyId`;
- `propertyId` references `properties.id` with `onDelete: "cascade"`;
- ordinary list/get/create/update/delete behavior through `lib/services/*`;
- create/update/delete Server Actions that validate unknown input with Zod.

It refuses field-only changes, identity or cross-org tables, join tables, self-references,
multi-table aggregates, backfills, destructive migrations, UI work, imports, MCP tools,
and speculative entities. Route those to a feature, migration, or separately approved
specialized pipeline.

## Exit condition

A run passes only when all checks are true:

1. The unchanged contract test written by Explore is red before the scaffold and green after.
2. The Zod type, Drizzle table, schema barrel export, generated migration, service, Server
   Actions, seed loader entry, and meaningful fixture all implement the approved contract.
3. The focused live-DB test proves create → list/get → update → delete, domain/DB type
   conversion, property filtering, and organization isolation. It must also prove that create
   and update reject a `propertyId` owned by another organization. It cleans up every row it creates.
4. The generated migration is additive and `npm run db:check` passes. Applying it is allowed
   only after the development-branch identity has been confirmed; production is forbidden.
5. `npx vitest run`, `npx tsc --noEmit`, and `npx eslint app lib components` retain the
   run's starting health.

## Verification technique

This pipeline uses **contract tests plus live database integration tests**. The contract test
proves all required layers exist and agree on names and fields. The live test proves the SQL
and organization predicates actually work; a mocked unit test cannot establish tenant
isolation. Drizzle's code-first migration flow compares the TypeScript schema with the latest
snapshot to generate SQL, while `drizzle-kit check` detects migration-history conflicts:

- https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/drizzle-kit-generate
- https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/kit-overview

The verifier also inspects the generated SQL because a clean migration graph does not prove
that an individual migration is non-destructive.

## Stages

`explore → plan → execute → eval`. Each stage has a fresh context. Execute is the maker;
Eval is a different-model, read-only verifier.

- **Explore:** validate the scope gate, map the closest existing entity pattern, record
  baseline gates, and write the failing contract/integration test.
- **Plan:** enumerate every file and approved field mapping. The first real run stops here
  for human approval.
- **Execute:** implement only the approved plan in an isolated worktree and generate the migration.
- **Eval:** independently inspect the migration and run the focused and global gates.

## Guardrails

- **Training mode:** locked on while the pipeline is unproven. The workflow first stops after
  Plan and resumes with `--resume=<run-id> --approved-plan`. It stops again after generating
  the migration and resumes with `--approved-migration`. Removing these stops requires a
  later, reviewed pipeline-definition change after a successful real run is recorded.
- **Isolation:** one pipeline run per git worktree.
- **Database:** development Neon branch only. Never production, never `seed:reset`, never
  `ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE_DB=1`.
- **Additive only:** no `DROP`, `TRUNCATE`, data rewrite, rename, or destructive column change.
- **Bounds:** maximum 4 recorded build attempts, a 75-minute call-launch window, 7 agent
  calls per invocation, and a declared 60,000-token ceiling. The workflow stops launching
  calls after the time window, but the current API cannot cancel a call already in flight.
  It also does not expose live token metering, so the fixed agent-call cap is the enforceable
  local proxy; a future dispatcher must enforce the token ceiling at launch.
- **No progress:** stop after the same verifier failure occurs twice consecutively.
- **Human checkpoints:** approval of the entity contract, approval of Plan, and approval
  before applying the generated migration.
- **Memory:** append failures and reusable lessons to `agent-loop/memory/errors.md`.

## Status and trigger

Authored but not yet product-proven because the scope-reduction pass found no approved new
entity ticket. Invoke `workflow.js` with a ticket path. The first invocation returns after
Plan; inspect it, then resume with the emitted run ID and `--approved-plan`. After Execute
generates the SQL, inspect that exact file and resume with the same flags plus
`--approved-migration`.
