# Agent Loops for Valgate

> Goal: stop hand-prompting one task at a time. Build **loops** — small systems that
> find work, hand it to an agent, verify the result, record what happened, and decide
> the next step — so Valgate work runs on a cadence instead of a keystroke.

## The one-sentence definition

> **An LLM agent runs tools in a loop to achieve a goal.** — Simon Willison

That's the whole idea. Everything below is about making that loop *reliable* and *safe*
enough to leave running.

## The core loop (the "heartbeat")

Every agent, from ReAct (2022) to Claude Code (2025), is the same cycle:

```
        ┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
        │                                           │
   ┌────▼────┐    ┌────────┐    ┌─────────┐    ┌────┴─────┐
   │  PLAN   │ →  │  ACT   │ →  │ OBSERVE │ →  │  VERIFY  │
   │ (reason)│    │ (tool) │    │(result) │    │ (check)  │
   └─────────┘    └────────┘    └─────────┘    └──────────┘
      goal in        run a         read the      pass? → done
                     command       output        fail? → loop
```

- **Plan** — the model reasons about the next step (break a big goal into subtasks).
- **Act** — it runs *one* concrete tool: a shell command, a DB query, an API call.
- **Observe** — it reads the result and decides if the plan still holds.
- **Verify** — a check (ideally a *separate* agent or a test suite) confirms the work.
  Fail → loop again. Pass → exit.

**Throughput of the whole thing is set by how fast you can run one lap of that loop.**
Karpathy's point: the leverage is in *speeding up verification*, not writing longer prompts.

> **A loop is one node, not the whole picture.** IndyDevDan's counterpoint (see resources §7):
> the loop is just the *pass/fail route back to the build agent* — one piece of control flow. The
> real unit is an **AI Developer Workflow (ADW)**: prompts in → a mix of **code + agents** → results
> out. His three actors of value creation — **engineers, agents, and code** — and the reminder that
> *code is the unsung hero* (fast, deterministic, zero-token) are the frame to keep. Build a solid
> loop first, then wire loops into workflows as the work gets bigger.

## The five things that turn a chat into a loop

From Boris Cherny (built Claude Code) and Dex Horthy (12-Factor Agents):

| Piece | What it does | In practice for Valgate |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Goal** | A recursive purpose the agent iterates toward | "Every failing test in `tests/authz/` is green" |
| **2. Verification** | A *separate* agent/test decides pass/fail — the single most important design choice | `npm run test`, `tsc`, `/verify`, a second agent reviewing the diff |
| **3. Memory** | State written to a file so tomorrow's run resumes today's | `CLAUDE.md` for lessons; a `progress.md` for where it stopped |
| **4. Scheduling** | Discovery + triage on a cadence, terminal open or not | cron / `/loop` / a nightly routine |
| **5. Guardrails** | Isolation + least-privilege creds so an autonomous run can't hurt you | git worktrees, test/staging DB branch, scoped keys |

> **Verification is the linchpin.** "The most consequential design choice in a loop is
> splitting the agent that writes the code from the agent that checks it." — Boris Cherny.
> If you can't check it automatically, it's not ready to be a loop yet.

## The four loop *types* (pick the weakest one that works)

From Anthropic's own "Getting Started with Loops." These are rungs — climb only when the
lower one isn't enough. Each maps to a command your harness already has.

| Type | Trigger | Stops when | Command | Use for |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **1. Turn-based** | you prompt | the agent decides it's done | a normal message + a verify *skill* | one-off tasks; add a `/verify` skill so it self-checks |
| **2. Goal-based** | you, with success criteria | goal met **or** turn limit hit | `/goal` (or `/code-build-loop`) | verifiable exit: test pass-rate, tsc count, a score |
| **3. Time-based** | a clock | the interval you set | `/loop` (local) · `/schedule` (cloud) | recurring work, monitoring external systems |
| **4. Proactive** | an event, no human | you stop it | scheduling + goal + skills combined | bug triage, dependency upgrades, standing streams |

**Getting-started recipe (Anthropic):** find a bottleneck task → automate exactly *one*
element of it — the **verification check**, the **stop condition**, or the **trigger** — then
start simple and iterate. Don't build a proactive loop first; earn your way up the table.

## Codex's five building blocks (same idea, different vocabulary)

Daniel Vaughan's Codex CLI writeup names the same machinery, useful as a checklist:
**Automations** (cron + a persistent memory file), **Goal Mode** (runs for hours with a
*separate verifier model* — "maker–verifier separation"), **Worktrees** (parallel git
isolation), **Subagents** (read-only reviewer vs. write-enabled implementer), **Skills**
(encoded conventions). And three failure modes to design against:

- **Verification weakness** → use a *read-only* verifier, never let the maker grade itself.
- **Comprehension debt** → require human sign-off on merges; don't merge what nobody understood.
- **Cognitive surrender** → rotate who reviews, so attention doesn't rubber-stamp.

---

## The autonomy slider (don't jump to full-auto)

Karpathy: don't try to build a self-driving car on day one. Build a **co-pilot with an
autonomy slider** and slide it up only as trust grows.

```
  human-in-loop  ─────────────────────────────►  full autonomy
  suggest & wait     auto within scope        find-work + run + verify unattended
  (safest)           ("YOLO in a box")        (only where verification is airtight)
```

Rule of thumb: **the slider can only go as far right as your verification is trustworthy.**
Airtight tests → safe to automate. Fuzzy "looks good?" → keep a human in the loop.

---

## When a task is a good loop candidate

Good loops have **a clear success signal and a trial-and-error shape** (Simon Willison):

- ✅ Fix failing tests / typecheck errors (the signal is literally green/red)
- ✅ Performance or bundle-size optimization (measure → change → re-measure)
- ✅ Dependency upgrades (does it still build + pass?)
- ✅ Data-audit / wiring sweeps across many files (Valgate has a whole corpus for this)
- ❌ Anything where "done" is a matter of taste with no measurable check — keep human-in-loop

---

## Safety, non-negotiable (this is backend territory — treat it carefully)

Autonomy without guardrails is how you lose data. Before sliding right:

1. **Isolate** — run in a git worktree or container, never straight on `main`.
2. **Least privilege** — give the loop a **test/staging** DB branch and scoped keys, not prod.
   - Valgate rule already on the books: **never `seed:reset`** — it destroys evolved seed data.
   - Neon dev branch, not the prod branch, for any loop that writes.
3. **Budget the blast radius** — small scope, one domain at a time, reversible steps.
4. **Keep context lean** — Horthy's "dumb zone": model recall degrades in the middle
   40–60% of a big context window. Less context in the loop = better decisions.

---

## Valgate loop starter ideas (ranked by how airtight the verification is)

1. **Green-the-authz-suite loop** — goal: `tests/authz/` 26/26 stays green after edits.
   Verification = `npm run test`. Airtight. Great first loop.
2. **tsc-error burndown loop** — goal: drive the M5 wiring worklist (~438 tsc errors) down.
   Verification = `tsc` count strictly decreasing. Airtight.
3. **Data-wiring sweep loop** — goal: eliminate mock/placeholder values per the WIRING-PLAYBOOK.
   Verification = a second agent checks each value traces to a schema field. Semi-airtight.
4. **QA-and-fix loop** — goal: no console errors / broken flows on key routes.
   Verification = the `/qa` browser agent. Semi-airtight; keep human-in-loop early.

Start at #1, keep the slider left, move it right only after a loop proves itself.

---

## Tooling you already have for this

- **`/loop`** — run a prompt or slash command on an interval (or self-paced).
- **`/build-loop "<idea>"`** — turns a loop idea into a runnable, safe-by-construction loop skill.
- **`/code-build-loop`**, **`/optimisation-loop`** — pre-built build/verify and metric-to-target loops.
- **`/verify`**, **`/code-review --fix`**, **`/qa`** — the *verification* half of any loop.
- **git worktrees** (Conductor already gives you isolated workspaces) — the *guardrail* half.

---

## This is an evolving system

**This loop system is never finished — its own improvement is a loop.** The moment we treat
it as "done," it starts rotting: pipelines drift, the same errors recur, slow stages stay
slow. So the system must **always be searching for ways to optimize itself.**

That's what [`memory/`](./memory/README.md) is for — the agent-loop's own mini-vault, mirroring
the repo's [Obsidian vault](../vault/obsidian.md):

- [`memory/changelog.md`](./memory/changelog.md) — what changed in the machinery, dated.
- [`memory/decisions.md`](./memory/decisions.md) — why the loop is built this way (ADRs).
- [`memory/errors.md`](./memory/errors.md) — what broke + the lesson, which feeds back into
  the offending pipeline's prompt so the fix propagates to every future run.

**The meta-loop:** on a cadence, a review pass reads `memory/` and asks — *what's the most
common error? which stage is slowest? which pipeline has the weakest verification?* — and
proposes the next improvement. Optimizing the system that builds the system is the highest-
leverage work here (IndyDevDan's "build the system that builds the system").

## Next step

The scaffold exists; nothing runs unattended yet. Prove the loop closes **by hand**:
step through [`pipelines/eslint-burndown/`](./pipelines/eslint-burndown/pipeline.md)
(explore → plan → execute → eval) and watch `eval` go red then green. Then run
`execute ↔ eval` as a built-in **`Workflow`** (separate agents, loop-until pass), and only
then build the orchestrator over many pipelines. Everything runs on built-in primitives —
no external tools — so the system stays self-contained.
