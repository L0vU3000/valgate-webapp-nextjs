## Stack

| Concern | Library |
|---|---|
| Styling | Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui |
| Auth | Clerk |
| Database | Convex |
| Validation | Zod |
| Forms | React Hook Form + Zod |
| Email | Resend |
| Payments | Stripe |
| Rate Limiting | Upstash Redis |
| Env validation | @t3-oss/env-nextjs |

## Core Rules

- **Default to Server Components.** Add `"use client"` only at the leaf level when needed.
- **Fetch in Server Components** — never `useEffect` for initial data loads.
- **One action file per domain** — `post.actions.ts`, `user.actions.ts`, etc.
- **Always `await params`** — it's a Promise in Next.js 15.
- **Convex mutations/queries over Server Actions** for anything touching the DB.

## Data Flow

```
Client Component → Server Action → revalidateTag
                                        ↓
Client Component ← Server Component re-fetches fresh data
```

---

## Security Rules

**Client → Server (treat all input as hostile)**
- Validate every input with Zod before touching the DB
- Authenticate (who are you?) AND authorize (do you own this?) on every mutation
- Never return `err.message` to the client — log internally, return generic strings
- Rate limit login, signup, and all sensitive actions

**Server → Client (be deliberate about what you expose)**
- Never send full DB objects as props — `select` only what the UI renders
- Never pass secrets as props to Client Components — use them server-side, pass the result
- Never prefix secrets with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` — it inlines them into the browser bundle

## Anti-Patterns

| ❌ Anti-Pattern | ✅ Fix |
|---|---|
| `"use client"` on every file | Default to Server; add only when needed |
| `useEffect` for initial data fetch | Fetch directly in Server Component |
| Secrets in `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` | Server-only env vars for secrets |
| Raw `fetch` with no cache strategy | Use `unstable_cache` or `cache()` |
| Business logic in route handlers | Move to `services/` or `actions/` |
| No `loading.tsx` on data-heavy routes | Add a skeleton per route segment |
| Accessing `params` synchronously | Always `await params` |
| Raw FormData passed to DB | Validate through Zod first |
| Auth check without ownership check | Verify resource belongs to the user (IDOR) |
| Returning `err.message` to client | Log internally, return generic error string |
| Full DB object passed as props | Select only the fields the UI needs |
| Secrets passed as props to Client | Use server-side, pass only the result |
| No rate limiting on auth actions | Rate limit login, signup, sensitive mutations |

This project uses [Convex](https://convex.dev) as its backend.

When working on Convex code, **always read `convex/_generated/ai/guidelines.md` first** for important guidelines on how to correctly use Convex APIs and patterns. The file contains rules that override what you may have learned about Convex from training data.

Convex agent skills for common tasks can be installed by running `npx convex ai-files install`.
